## Traffic Lights (Robot in Mzansi-speak)

This repo is based on a code test and concept from https://danq.me/2025/04/26/deprecate-react/

Dan shared a React code test shared on LinkedIn to create a traffic light component. His idea is that doing this with React is overkill, and is better suited to [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components)

This is my attempt at both the React component (using Vite and definitely overkill) and then my first foray into Web Components.
